# Inventory-Data
This repository contains Excel data files used for Power BI dashboards.

 Project: Inventory Stock Management (Excel)

Description:
This Excel file is used to manage and analyze inventory data.
I performed several data cleaning and transformation steps such as removing duplicates, correcting data formats, and adding calculated columns.

Using the cleaned data, I created Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to summarize stock levels, purchase and sales performance, and overall profit-loss.
Finally, I designed an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize stock trends and key performance metrics.

Key Highlights:

Data Cleaning (removed errors, handled missing values, corrected formatting)

Created Pivot Tables and Charts for analysis

Built an interactive Dashboard for visualization

Used Excel formulas for calculations and profit/loss analysis


Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel
